## 📌 Project Status
This project is **currently under active development**.  
Core features and backend structure are being implemented incrementally.

> ⚠️ Note: The UI shown in the presentation represents the **initial design concept and system planning**.  
> The current implementation may differ slightly as the app evolves during development.

## 🎯 Project Goal
University systems are often fragmented (SIMS, paper routines, emails), causing delays and confusion.  
This app aims to unify:
- Academic schedules
- Results & CGPA
- Announcements & reminders
- Tuition & payment information
- Faculty & department data

into a **single real-time mobile dashboard**.
